**************************Database testing*******************************

1.what is it?
  Validating the data that is displayed on the UI is matching with the data that is stored in the
   database.
  Ensures that data store is valid,consistent and secure.

2 database:
  collection of related data. 

3.DBMS:
  In storing the related data in the database in an organized manner to make it easier to CRUD in the database.

-DataBase Testing revolves around 4 major things 
 a)Data Mapping: data mapping is ussually done in frontend data testing where data is mapped from the UI of the application with database. It checks that whether all frontend data is stored 
  correctly in th database

 b)ACID Properties: Acid properties are:

    i)Atomicity : let assume there are two peoples A and B .When transaction is initiated between A&B ,Cash is debited form A's account at same time amount is credited 
                  B's account.it either processes the transaction in one go.If something goes wrong while transaction, atomicity makes sure that everything goes back to
                  how it was before, so nothing gets messed up.

   ii)Consistency:consitency validates that data is accurate,valid and reliable .if data is consistent means data follows valid rules,standards and expectations.if 100Rs are debited from A's
                  account but not credited to B's account, it would result in a loss of 100Rs, causing an inconsistency in the data. Similarly, if 100Rs are credited to B's account but not debited from A's account,
                  it would result in an unjustified increase in B's account balance, also causing an inconsistency in the data. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that both operations are executed atomically and 
                  consistently to maintain data consistency. thats how consistent the transaction happen.

   iii)Isolation : isolation ensures that multiple transactiondoes not interfere with each other.

   iv) Durability : data is persistent, so after transaction data should be stored properly is the database.

 c)Data integrity : integrity is achieved when the data is capable of doing CRUD operation that are {Create ,Read,update ,delete}.

 d)Buissness rules: they dictate how data should be stored, processed, and accessed. For example, just like in a game where you have rules to follow to play fairly, in a database, 
                    there are rules that ensure data is handled correctly and consistently.

4.to have a handson on database testing i had used classicmodels database and created set of schemas, store procedures and triggers and created testcase on them and also 
  automated them.
